SHMs are a powerful visualization tool for focused analyses routines comparing assay profiles among smaller numbers of biomolecules across cell types and conditions. This is the case because each biomolecule requires its own SHM plot. To support analysis routines involving large numbers of different biomolecules, we have integrated functionalities for large-scale data analysis. These functionalities include Spatial Enrichment for identifying groups of biomolecules with similar or opposite assay profiles. Data mining methods, such as clustering and network analysis, are also included that scale to much larger numbers of biomolecules than SHMs.

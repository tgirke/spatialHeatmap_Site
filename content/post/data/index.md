The software supports anatomical images from public repositories (e.g. EBI anatomogram) or those provided by users. In general any type of image can be used as long as it can be provided in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format and the corresponding spatial features, such as organs, tissues, cellular compartments, are annotated with unique identifiers. The numeric values plotted onto an SHM are usually quantitative measurements from a wide range of profiling technologies, such as microarrays, next generation sequencing (e.g. RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq), proteomics, metabolomics, or many other small- or large-scale experiments.
